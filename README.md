# Fun

Fun small projects, jokes, programming practical tests, and algorithm implementations.

### Interviews

Interviews are projects I did for various companies. They're all fairly standard; nothing confidential or super-specific.

### Miniprojects

These are just small, fun projects that I could work on quickly and never use again.
