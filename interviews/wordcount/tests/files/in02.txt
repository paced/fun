pytest: helps you write better programs
The pytest framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

An example of a simple test:

# content of test_sample.py
def inc(x):
    return x + 1


def test_answer():
    assert inc(3) == 5
To execute it:

$ pytest
=========================== test session starts ============================
platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-5.x.y, py-1.x.y, pluggy-0.x.y
cachedir: $PYTHON_PREFIX/.pytest_cache

test_sample.py F                                                     [100%]

================================= FAILURES =================================

    def test_answer():

E       assert 4 == 5
E        +  where 4 = inc(3)

test_sample.py:6: AssertionError
============================ 1 failed in 0.12s =============================
Due to pytestâ€™s detailed assertion introspection, only plain assert statements are used. See Getting Started for more examples.
